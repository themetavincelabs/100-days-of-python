  day-01 (12.26.22)
  starting fresh from ground zero
  
  my goals here are to understand how computers think, be able to program them and ultimatley write my own dApps and smart contracts
  
  the first step in completing the goals above are to get a basic understanding of computer languages through python, explore the libraries and eventually learn solidity - the language of ethereum and the open internet
  
  my plans are to eventually contribute in a meaningful way to this new revolution we're calling, "the internet of value"

day 01.1 (12.26.22)

the first exercise i've completed on this new journey, a simple band name generator i think i've done about 5x previously

i dont care that im doing this over again, 

perfect is the enemy of good

consistency is key

now off to play MW2 until 7pm then back in the saddle

below is the python:
###name generator
#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("gm!\n")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What city did you grow up in?\n ")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n ")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name is: " + city + " " +pet + " !!")
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:
print("\n")

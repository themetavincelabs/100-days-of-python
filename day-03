missed yesterday

i am very sick..but was thinking about the class the whole time

this is not really a game of smarts, but rather a game of perserverance, grit and the ability to stick with it

that's what will get me through all of this

coding is very fun, its similar to solving a puzzle - the gymastics have limits, functions and bounds you need to operate within

things are getting a bit harder, with for and while loops

===============

its also a bit harder as an adult..you get into tha habbit of things, learning a new skill is not the "norm"

just finished day 6 and will move onto day 7 and potentially day 8 to recoup my progress

here's what i did with reeebord #4

def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

    
def jump():   
    turn_left()
    while (front_is_clear() == True) and (wall_on_right == True):
        move()
        if right_is_clear() == True:
            turn_right()
            move()
            turn_right()
            move()
            turn_left()
                    
    
while at_goal() == False:
    if front_is_clear() == True:
        move()
    if right_is_clear() == True:
        turn_right()
    elif wall_in_front() == True:
        jump()

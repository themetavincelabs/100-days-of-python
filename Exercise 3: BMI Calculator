# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

bmi = round((weight / height**2), 2)

#the way this logic works is that it checks based off of the previous if statement which is why we don't need to inout ranges, it is one whole if statement working together

if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slighly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")

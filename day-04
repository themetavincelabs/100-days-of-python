i am pretty bad at construcing for lopps as of now. i get the concept, but i feel that when i decalre the "i" variable, i mess up the reference point

the hangman exercise messed me up a bit. i almost folded, but just need to keep going

there are some things im good at, others i'm not, i am leaning into the things im good at

perfection is the enemy of good

1% better everyday

coding is a lifelong journey

my goals are to power through this couse everyday, no matter what to learn the broad strokes of everything, then drill into core competencies at the end 

this is only my first of many coding journeys

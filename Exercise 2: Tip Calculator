still on calendar day 1

apparently im above 50% of all people who start something and don't finish it - but i dont feel that way. i feel like im still someone who starts things and doesn't finish them 

maybe ill feel accomplished once i finish this course

here's my proof of work:



#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

###asks what the bill is and stores it in a variable
bill = float(input("What is the bill? $ "))

###asks how many people there are and stores it in a variable
people = int(input("How many people are eating? "))

###asks what % the tip is and stores it in a variable
tip = float(input("What (%) tip would you like to give?? "))

###operates on tip to turn it from a WHOLE number to a decimal
tip_percent = tip/100

###refernces bill and operated on tip_percent to get the total bill
bill_total = bill * (1 +  tip_percent)

###divides total bill and the amount of people
bill_per_person = round(bill_total / people, 2)

###stores message in variable
amount = f"Each person should pay$ {bill_per_person}"

###prints message
print(amount)

#You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

#Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

#define an operator
num = 0

#user if, elif, else logic because these are all mutually exclusive
# if you just did a bunch of IFs, it would only output Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz and no numbers
##You need the "else" to return the numbers
###YOU NEED TO WRITE THE FIZZBUZZ CODE FIRST becuase if Fizz is the first output, it will only return "Fizz" and not operate the rest of the IF statements!!!!
for number in range (1, 101):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    else:
        print(number)
